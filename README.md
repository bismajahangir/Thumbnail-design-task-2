# 🎨 Design Task 2 – YouTube Thumbnail Design for Python Course Playlist

## 🎯 Task Overview:
This project showcases a **fully custom-designed** thumbnail set for a complete **Python programming course playlist**. All thumbnails were created from scratch using **Adobe Photoshop**, with a strong focus on visual consistency, clarity, and bold educational branding.

---

## ✅ Tools Used:
- **Adobe Photoshop** – Entire design process including layout, image treatment, lighting effects, and typography  
- **YouTube Playlist** – Used only for content reference (no external templates or assets)

---

## 🎨 Design Process:

### 📌 Layout & Structure:
- Designed a consistent thumbnail layout with **centered bold headings**  
- Below each heading, a **custom topic tab (rectangle)** highlights the lecture title  
- Used structured spacing and alignment for balance across all 9 thumbnails

---

### 🧠 Background & Visual Effects:

- Added a **code-textured background**, manually enhanced using **Gaussian Blur** for soft focus  
- Applied a **dark orange stroke** behind the main title text (“PYTHON 2025”) for contrast and depth  
- Used **blending options** (Overlay, Multiply) to merge background elements smoothly  
- Incorporated **blue and yellow brush glare effects** to give the design a dynamic, tech-inspired feel  
- Used soft **shadows** under key elements and **glow effects** behind text/instructor for depth and focus  

---

### 🎭 Instructor Image Treatment:

- Retouched the instructor image using **Camera Raw Filter** for clean, professional appearance  
- Added a **soft brush-based glow** around the instructor using custom opacity and layer modes  
- Positioned the image strategically to balance layout and maintain focus

---

### 🐍 Python Branding Elements:

- Used official **Python logos**, positioned on each side  
- Applied **motion blur** to logos to create a sense of energy and movement  
- Ensured consistent sizing and placement for branding balance

---

### 🏷️ Lecture Badge Design:

- Added a **custom badge** (e.g., "Lecture 01") in each thumbnail  
- Rectangle and text styled with a **yellow-to-orange gradient**  
- Carefully placed for easy readability and consistent branding

---

### 🔤 Typography:

- **Impact font** used for the bold “PYTHON” title (strong & futuristic)  
- **Poppins Bold & Regular** used for all other text, ensuring readability and consistency

---

## 📐 Output Details:

- **Total Thumbnails:** 9  
- **Resolution:** 1280 × 720 pixels (YouTube standard)  
- **Final Format:** JPG  
- **Source Files:** PSD  
- **Color Mode:** RGB  
- **Fonts Used:**  
  - **Impact** (for main heading)  
  - **Poppins** (Bold & Regular for subtext and topics)
